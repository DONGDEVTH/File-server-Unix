Static IP Address Assignment

To configure your system to use a static IP address assignment, add the static method to the inet address family statement for the appropriate interface in the file /etc/network/interfaces. The example below assumes you are configuring your first Ethernet interface identified as eth0. Change the address, netmask, and gateway values to meet the requirements of your network.

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 10.0.0.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 10.0.0.1



By adding an interface configuration as shown above, you can manually enable the interface through the ifup command.

sudo ifup eth0
To manually disable the	interface, you can use the ifdown command.

sudo ifdown eth0
